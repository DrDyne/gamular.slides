<h2>$resource</h2>

<blockquote>
  <span class="fragment fade-out" data-fragment-index="1">It is important to realize that
  invoking a $resource object method immediately returns an empty reference (object or array depending on isArray).</span>
  Once the data is returned from the server the existing reference is populated with the actual data.
  <span class="fragment fade-out" data-fragment-index="1">This is a useful trick since usually the resource is assigned to a model which is then rendered by the view.
  Having an empty object results in no rendering, once the data arrives from the server then the object is populated with the data and the view automatically re-renders itself showing the new data.
  This means that </span>
  in most cases one never has to write a callback function for the action methods.
